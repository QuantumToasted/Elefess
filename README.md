# Elefess
Elefess is a Git LFS server implementation following the [API spec](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/8e96b5d5d84095d1c0dd0c550d8fdf2c8c5c6456/docs/api/README.md), allowing for the design and usage of fully custom Git LFS servers beyond those provided by popular Git hosts such as GitHub or GitLab.
